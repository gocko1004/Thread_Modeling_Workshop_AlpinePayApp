# Kill Chain Attack Description: AlpinePay Attack Scenario

## **Stages of the Attack**

1. **Origins**:
   - The attacker identifies AlpinePay as a high-value target due to its sensitive financial data, public-facing APIs, and AI-driven trading systems.

2. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The attacker gathers information about AlpinePay’s infrastructure, exposed endpoints, and vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Weaponization**:
   - The attacker crafts malicious payloads targeting API vulnerabilities and sophisticated phishing emails tailored to administrators and users.

4. **Delivery**:
   - Phishing emails with malicious links or attachments are sent to users and administrators, mimicking trusted financial communications.

5. **Exploitation**:
   - Vulnerabilities in public-facing APIs and phishing payloads are exploited to gain unauthorized access to the backend.

6. **Installation**:
   - Backdoors are established, and malware is implanted within AlpinePay’s infrastructure to maintain persistent access.

7. **Actions on Objectives**:
   - **Exfiltrate financial data:** Extract sensitive transaction records and customer data.
   - **Manipulate AI trading algorithms:** Inject unauthorized changes to create financial instability or profit.
   - **Trigger fraudulent transactions:** Conduct unauthorized transfers or disrupt payment processes..
