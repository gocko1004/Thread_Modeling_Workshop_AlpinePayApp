# Summary MITRE ATT&CK Sequence

## **Attack Description**

### **Stages of the Attack**

1. **Origins**:
   - The attacker identifies AlpinePay as a high-value target due to its financial data and AI-driven trading algorithms.

2. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The attacker conducts research to gather information about AlpinePay’s infrastructure, exposed APIs, and software stack.

3. **Weaponization**:
   - The attacker crafts malicious payloads to exploit API vulnerabilities and phishing campaigns targeting administrative accounts.

4. **Delivery**:
   - Malicious payloads are delivered through multi-channel phishing campaigns (email, SMS, and social media).

5. **Exploitation**:
   - Vulnerabilities in public-facing APIs are exploited to gain unauthorized access, or users are tricked into executing malware.

6. **Installation**:
   - The attacker installs backdoors or malicious scripts to maintain persistence within AlpinePay’s infrastructure.

7. **Command and Control (C2)**:
   - The attacker uses encrypted channels or cloud-based C2 servers for stealthy communication.

8. **Actions on Objectives**:
   - **Steal financial data:** Exfiltrate sensitive customer and transaction data.
   - **Manipulate trading algorithms:** Introduce biases or unauthorized changes to generate financial losses or gains.
   - **Trigger fraudulent transactions:** Exploit backend systems for unauthorized money transfers.
