**Controls Required:**

1. **Enhanced Security Audits:**
   - Conduct regular security audits, including vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
   - Include red team exercises to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
   - Perform regular threat modeling workshops to assess emerging threats and improve defense mechanisms.

2. **Advanced Patch Management:**
   - Automate dependency scanning and patching for third-party libraries.
   - Integrate vulnerability scanning tools directly into CI/CD pipelines for real-time detection and resolution of risks.

3. **AI-Driven Phishing Awareness:**
   - Use AI simulations to train employees against highly personalized phishing attempts.
   - Introduce periodic gamified phishing detection challenges to enhance employee engagement and awareness.

4. **Modern Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Deploy a WAF with machine learning capabilities to detect unusual patterns and adapt to evolving threats.
   - Continuously monitor and update WAF rules to address new zero-day vulnerabilities.

5. **Passwordless Authentication:**
   - Implement passwordless authentication using FIDO2/WebAuthn standards for improved security and user convenience.
   - Include biometric authentication as an alternative or complement to MFA.
   - Ensure fallback mechanisms for recovery in cases of lost or inaccessible credentials.

6. **Comprehensive Network Monitoring:**
   - Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
   - Use behavior-based anomaly detection tools to spot insider threats and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

7. **Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Apply the principle of least privilege dynamically with just-in-time access provisioning.
   - Regularly audit roles and permissions to prevent privilege creep and reduce attack surface.

8. **Incident Response and Recovery:**
   - Develop and test a comprehensive incident response plan to handle breaches effectively.
   - Ensure backups are encrypted, regularly tested, and stored offsite to mitigate ransomware risks.
   - Include post-incident reviews to continuously improve the response process.

9. **Data Encryption:**
   - Enforce end-to-end encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Use strong encryption standards, such as AES-256, to protect critical data from unauthorized access.

10. **Continuous Training and Awareness:**
    - Provide regular training sessions on emerging threats and secure practices.
    - Update employee training to reflect the latest social engineering techniques used in attacks.
