| Risk ID | Description                                         | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan                                      |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| R1      | Lack of encryption for sensitive data transmission | High     | Medium     | High   | Enforce TLS/SSL and enable encryption for all data in transit and at rest. |
| R2      | Weak authentication mechanisms                     | Medium   | High       | High   | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and explore passwordless options using FIDO2/WebAuthn. |
| R3      | Vulnerable third-party libraries                   | Medium   | High       | Medium | Automate dependency scanning and patch management within CI/CD pipelines. |
| R4      | Insufficient logging and monitoring                | High     | Medium     | High   | Deploy a centralized SIEM solution with real-time alerting and anomaly detection. |
| R5      | Lack of disaster recovery plan                     | High     | High       | High   | Regularly test and update a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. Ensure encrypted backups are stored offsite. |
| R6      | API abuse through insufficient validation          | High     | High       | High   | Implement strict API validation, rate limiting, and WAF rules for public-facing APIs. |
| R7      | AI model theft or adversarial ML attacks           | Medium   | Medium     | High   | Encrypt AI models, restrict access using RBAC, and monitor for unusual model queries. |
