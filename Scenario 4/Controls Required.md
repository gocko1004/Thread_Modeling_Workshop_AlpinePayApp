# Controls Required for Scenario 4: Insider Threat Involving AI Models

## **Recommended Controls**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Enforce RBAC to limit access to AI models based on job roles.
   - Regularly audit role assignments to prevent privilege creep.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Require MFA for accessing administrative tools and sensitive data storage.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt AI models at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Audit Logs and Monitoring**:
   - Maintain detailed logs of access to AI models and administrative actions.
   - Use anomaly detection to identify unusual activity patterns.

5. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Access**:
   - Grant temporary access to AI models only when necessary, reducing exposure.

6. **Data Integrity Protections**:
   - Implement cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity of AI models.
   - Monitor for unauthorized changes or tampering.

7. **Training and Awareness**:
   - Educate employees on insider threat risks and responsibilities.
   - Conduct regular training to recognize suspicious behavior.

8. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Develop and test a response plan specifically for insider threats.
   - Include procedures for isolating compromised systems and investigating breaches.
