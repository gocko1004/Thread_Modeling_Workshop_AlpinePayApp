# Controls Required for Scenario 3: SQL Injection Attack

## **Recommended Controls**

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Enforce strict sanitization of all user inputs to prevent injection of malicious queries.

2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Deploy a WAF to block known SQL injection patterns and protect against malicious requests.

3. **Prepared Statements**:
   - Use parameterized queries to ensure that user inputs cannot alter query structure.

4. **Database Hardening**:
   - Restrict database permissions to the minimum necessary.
   - Use stored procedures to encapsulate and control query execution.

5. **Detection and Monitoring**:
   - Implement database activity monitoring (DAM) to detect and log abnormal queries.
   - Use tools to analyze logs for potential SQL injection attempts.

6. **Regular Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct frequent security testing targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

7. **Zero Trust Access**:
   - Require strong authentication for database access.
   - Continuously validate and monitor access permissions.
