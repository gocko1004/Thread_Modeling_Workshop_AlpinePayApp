# Kill Chain Attack Description: AlpinePay Attack Scenario 2

## **Attack Scenario: Manipulation of Automated Trading Algorithms**

### **Stages of the Attack**

1. **Origins**:
   - The attacker identifies AlpinePay’s AI-driven trading algorithms as a valuable target for financial manipulation or market disruption.

2. **Reconnaissance**:
   - The attacker gathers intelligence on the trading algorithm’s data inputs, model architecture, and deployment environments.

3. **Weaponization**:
   - Malicious payloads are crafted to inject biased data into the algorithm's input streams or to exploit vulnerabilities in the model’s API.

4. **Delivery**:
   - Attack vectors include injecting corrupted data into market feeds, exploiting unsecured API endpoints, or phishing users to access algorithm management tools.

5. **Exploitation**:
   - Vulnerabilities in API endpoints or input validation mechanisms are exploited to introduce manipulated data or unauthorized parameter adjustments.

6. **Installation**:
   - Backdoors are established in the trading system to allow persistent tampering with the algorithm’s logic or decision-making processes.

7. **Actions on Objectives**:
   - **Distort market operations:** Manipulate trades to create artificial volatility or profit.
   - **Exfiltrate sensitive model data:** Extract proprietary algorithm designs or trade logic.
   - **Gain unauthorized financial control:** Execute unauthorized trades or drain financial accounts.
