# Controls Required for Scenario 2: Manipulation of Automated Trading Algorithms

## **Recommended Controls**

1. **API Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
   - Apply rate limiting and authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for API access.
   - Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules specifically tailored for API traffic.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access to trading algorithms and sensitive APIs.
   - Use Just-In-Time (JIT) access provisioning to grant temporary access only when needed.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Require MFA for all user and administrative access, especially for API management and trading functions.
   - Explore passwordless authentication options using FIDO2/WebAuthn for enhanced security.

4. **Data Integrity Protections:**
   - Implement mechanisms to validate the integrity of input data streams.
   - Monitor data sources for anomalies or signs of tampering.

5. **Threat Detection and Monitoring:**
   - Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for real-time monitoring and alerting.
   - Use machine learning-based anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns in trading algorithm operations.

6. **Encryption and Data Security:**
   - Ensure end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Encrypt trading algorithm models and restrict access using secure storage solutions.

7. **Incident Response and Recovery:**
   - Develop and test an incident response plan specifically for trading algorithm manipulation scenarios.
   - Maintain encrypted backups of trading algorithms and transaction data to ensure recovery in case of tampering.

8. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Train employees to recognize phishing attempts and social engineering tactics.
   - Provide specialized training for developers and administrators on secure API design and management.

9. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct periodic penetration testing focusing on API endpoints and algorithm management interfaces.
   - Perform regular code reviews to identify vulnerabilities in trading algorithms and related systems.

10. **Model Integrity Protections:**
    - Use cryptographic signing to ensure trading algorithms are not tampered with during deployment.
    - Monitor algorithm performance for unusual behavior that could indicate compromise.

By implementing these controls, AlpinePay can significantly reduce the risks associated with the manipulation of automated trading algorithms.
