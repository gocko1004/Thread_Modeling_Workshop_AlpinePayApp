# AI Threat Modeling Workshop Summary

## **Introduction**
This workshop was conducted to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities targeting **AlpinePay**, the flagship fintech application developed by **Alpine FinTech Solutions**. The session aimed to enhance the application's security posture by incorporating threat modeling into its development lifecycle, ensuring early identification of risks and mitigation strategies.

## **Attendees**
The workshop included participation from:
- AlpinePay Engineering Team
- Product Managers
- DevOps Engineers
- DevSecOps Team

## **Scope**
Four threat scenarios were evaluated during the workshop:
1. **AI-generated phishing campaign** targeting administrative credentials.
2. **Manipulation of automated trading algorithms.**
3. **SQL injection attack** exploiting API vulnerabilities.
4. **Insider threat** involving the theft of proprietary AI models.

## **Methodology**
The following frameworks and tools were utilized during the workshop:
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: To map the attack progression for each scenario.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: To analyze tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **STRIDE Framework**: To identify and assess control gaps and vulnerabilities.

## **Findings**
A total of **5 high-risk** and **2 medium-risk** threats were identified. These risks highlight critical security concerns that must be addressed to safeguard sensitive data, proprietary algorithms, and the application's infrastructure.

## **Controls Required**
To mitigate the identified risks, the following controls are recommended:
- Conduct regular security audits focused on AlpinePay.
- Implement robust patch management to ensure software and dependencies are up-to-date.
- Provide comprehensive phishing awareness training for employees.
- Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter and monitor traffic.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure user accounts.
- Continuously monitor network traffic to detect suspicious activities.
- Introduce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data and features.

## **Conclusion**
This workshop has laid the foundation for a proactive and robust security posture for AlpinePay by identifying vulnerabilities and establishing actionable controls. Moving forward, the focus will remain on:
- Strengthening DevSecOps practices to "shift security left."
- Conducting regular threat modeling workshops to anticipate and mitigate new threats.
- Ensuring ongoing training for all team members on security best practices.

The collaboration across teams demonstrates Alpine FinTech Solutions' commitment to delivering a secure and resilient fintech application to its users.
